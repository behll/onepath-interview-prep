    üéØ FINAL INTERVIEW CHECKLIST
    ============================
    
    BEFORE THE INTERVIEW:
    ‚ñ° Test your screen sharing setup
    ‚ñ° Prepare your IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
    ‚ñ° Have Python environment ready with FastAPI
    ‚ñ° Review your code files one more time
    ‚ñ° Practice saying key phrases aloud
    ‚ñ° Prepare 3-5 clarifying questions to ask
    
    INTERVIEW OPENING (First 5 minutes):
    ‚ñ° Greet interviewers warmly and professionally
    ‚ñ° Ask clarifying questions about the scenario:
        ‚Ä¢ "What's the typical customer behavior pattern?"
        ‚Ä¢ "Should I assume external APIs exist for calendar/pricing?"
        ‚Ä¢ "What's the priority - speed of implementation or robustness?"
    ‚ñ° Explain your overall approach before coding:
        ‚Ä¢ "I'll use ReACT architecture for the reasoning..."
        ‚Ä¢ "My agent orchestration will handle..."
        ‚Ä¢ "The prompt engineering will adapt to..."
    
    DURING CODING (Main 40 minutes):
    ‚ñ° CONSTANTLY narrate your thought process
    ‚ñ° Start with the core ReACT agent structure
    ‚ñ° Show prompt composition clearly
    ‚ñ° Demonstrate agent chaining
    ‚ñ° Handle the bundle followup scenario
    ‚ñ° Ask questions about edge cases:
        ‚Ä¢ "How should I handle API failures?"
        ‚Ä¢ "What if a customer changes their mind?"
        ‚Ä¢ "Should I optimize for cost or speed here?"
    
    HANDLING REQUIREMENT CHANGES:
    ‚ñ° Respond positively: "Great point! Let me adapt..."
    ‚ñ° Analyze impact: "This affects [X] because..."
    ‚ñ° Ask clarifications: "For this change, should I..."
    ‚ñ° Show flexibility: "I can extend this by..."
    
    KEY TECHNICAL POINTS TO EMPHASIZE:
    ‚ñ° ReACT reasoning loops (Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation)
    ‚ñ° Dynamic prompt composition based on context
    ‚ñ° Agent specialization and orchestration
    ‚ñ° Error handling and graceful degradation
    ‚ñ° Microservice architecture patterns
    ‚ñ° Context management across conversation turns
    
    COMMUNICATION EXCELLENCE:
    ‚ñ° Use phrases like:
        ‚Ä¢ "Let me think through this step by step..."
        ‚Ä¢ "My reasoning here is..."
        ‚Ä¢ "The prompt I would design is..."
        ‚Ä¢ "To handle this edge case, I would..."
        ‚Ä¢ "A clarifying question I have is..."
    ‚ñ° Ask business context questions:
        ‚Ä¢ "How do customers typically express urgency?"
        ‚Ä¢ "What's the business priority here?"
        ‚Ä¢ "How should I optimize for customer experience?"
    
    CLOSING (Last 10 minutes):
    ‚ñ° Summarize what you built
    ‚ñ° Discuss next steps and improvements
    ‚ñ° Ask about their current system architecture
    ‚ñ° Show enthusiasm for the role and company
    
    RED FLAGS TO AVOID:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Silent coding without explanation
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not asking clarifying questions
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Being rigid when requirements change
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Focusing on perfect code over business logic
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not explaining your prompt design choices
