📡 SYSTEM LAYERS:

1. 🤖 AGENT LAYER (ReACT Implementation)
   ├── Reasoning Engine - Analyzes customer intent
   ├── Action Orchestrator - Selects and executes tools
   ├── Observation Handler - Processes results
   └── Response Generator - Creates customer-facing responses

2. 🔧 TOOLS LAYER (Function Calling)
   ├── Customer Analysis Tool - Intent & urgency detection
   ├── Calendar Integration Tool - Availability checking  
   ├── Pricing Calculator Tool - Cost & bundle optimization
   └── Business Logic Tools - Domain-specific operations

3. 📊 BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER
   ├── Service Classification - AC, heating, plumbing, electrical
   ├── Urgency Assessment - Emergency, high, normal, low
   ├── Bundle Optimization - Multi-service discounts

💡 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:

1. ReACT ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION
   "I've implemented the ReACT pattern with clear separation of reasoning,
    action execution, and observation phases. This ensures predictable
    agent behavior and makes debugging straightforward."

2. MULTI-STEP REASONING
   "The agent performs complex multi-step workflows - analyzing customer
    intent, checking availability, calculating pricing, and optimizing
    bundles. Each step informs the next, like human customer service."

3. BUSINESS LOGIC INTEGRATION  
   "I've separated business logic from agent orchestration. This makes
    it easy to integrate with real APIs, modify pricing strategies,
    and add new service types without changing the core agent."

4. CONVERSATION CONTINUITY
   "The system maintains conversation context, allowing natural followup
    requests like 'add thermostat too'. This creates a seamless customer
    experience across multiple interactions."

5. PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
   "I've included error handling, logging, session management, and
    fallback mechanisms. The architecture scales horizontally and
    integrates with existing business systems."

🤔 QUESTIONS FOR INTERVIEWER:

• "What's OnePath's current approach to agent orchestration?"
• "Are there specific external APIs I should integrate with?"
• "How do you handle conversation context in production?"
• "What's the expected scale for concurrent customer interactions?"
• "How do you measure agent performance and customer satisfaction?"

💪 CONFIDENCE BUILDERS:

• "This demonstrates production-ready agent engineering"
• "Shows deep understanding of customer service workflows"  
• "Exhibits business logic thinking beyond just technical implementation"
• "Proves ability to build scalable, maintainable systems"
• "Demonstrates AI engineering best practices"
