3. **Prompt Engineering System** (`prompt_engineering_system.py`)
   - Dynamic prompt composition
   - Context-aware modifications
   - Conversation state management

4. **Complete Scenario Demo** (`ac_repair_scenario_demo.py`)
   - End-to-end AC repair workflow
   - Agent chaining demonstration
   - Bundle request handling

## 🗣️ Communication Excellence

### Key Phrases to Use
- "Let me think through this step by step..."
- "My reasoning here is..."
- "The prompt I would design is..."
- "To handle this edge case, I would..."
- "A clarifying question I have is..."

### Essential Questions to Ask
- "What's the typical customer behavior pattern?"
- "How do customers usually express urgency?"
- "Should I assume external APIs exist for calendar/pricing?"
- "What's the business priority - speed or cost optimization?"
- "How should I handle API failures or edge cases?"

## 🔄 Handling Requirement Changes

The interview **will** include mid-task requirement changes. Practice responses:

- "Great point! Let me adapt the system for..."
- "This affects my [component] because..."
- "I can extend this architecture by..."
- "That's an interesting constraint that changes..."

### Common Changes to Expect
1. **Scope Expansion**: Add new service types (plumbing, electrical)
2. **Complexity Increase**: Multi-user support, concurrent requests
3. **Performance Constraints**: Response time limits, API call budgets
4. **Integration Requirements**: External APIs, CRM systems
5. **Feature Modifications**: Change existing behavior

## 🎪 Demo Scenario: AC Repair Workflow

### Initial Request
"My AC is broken. Can someone fix it this week?"

### Agent Flow
1. **Primary Agent**: Analyzes request, determines urgency
2. **Calendar Agent**: Checks technician availability
3. **Pricing Agent**: Calculates service costs
4. **Customer Followup**: "Can you add a thermostat too and bundle it?"
5. **Bundle Agent**: Optimizes multi-service pricing
6. **Final Quote**: Complete pricing and scheduling

### Key Technical Demonstrations
- ReACT reasoning loops
- Dynamic prompt composition
- Agent orchestration and chaining
- Context-aware decision making
- Business logic implementation

## 🏆 Success Criteria
